**Your personal information is yours. Your relationship with KRLX does not change that.**

In order to facilitate your account and membership with KRLX, we collect some personally identifiable information about you.
This privacy statement outlines:

- What information we collect,
- Why we collect it,
- Who sees the information that we collect,
- How long that information is retained,
- And your rights with regards to your personal information.

In general:

- If you are not signed in, we don't collect information from you outside of our server logs.
- You must provide us with affirmative consent before we will store any personal information on disk.
- If you choose to make an account, we collect the smallest amount of information necessary to service your account. You have the opportunity to provide additional information beyond what is required, but this is strictly optional and will not negatively affect your experience if you don't feel comfortable sharing.
- Our databases are fully encrypted, and some fields within our databases are further encrypted independently of the database as a whole.
- We do not sign you up to any email lists without your express permission.
- Your personal information is not, and never will be, sold to third parties.

## If you are not logged in

If you are not logged in, we do store your IP address, user agent string, and the pages you visit in our server logs.
These are encrypted on disk and are purged by our hosting provider after 72 hours.
Additionally, these server logs are managed separately from the Mission Control application code, and are only accessible to engineers.

## Other information we collect

If you choose to register an account, you will need to provide your name and email address (so that we can personalize your account and contact you via email if necessary).

Carleton community members who wish to apply for a radio show **must** provide their affiliation status, class year if applicable, and a valid US phone number.
Carleton community members can choose to provide additional information upon registration, such as major, hometown, or favorite music, _however this is not mandatory._

Carleton community members who wish to borrow items from the Record Libe **must** present their OneCard and consent to our storage of OneCard identifying information.

To assist with troubleshooting, we may keep a more detailed activity log if you are signed in.
This log can contain information such as your account identifier, the page(s) you visited, and appropriate timestamps.
This information is written, but not read, by the Mission Control application.

## Why do we collect the information that we do?

- We collect your name and email address in order to personalize your account and allow you to sign in without having to re-register each time you visit.
- We collect phone numbers, class year, and OneCard information from radio show hosts so that we can provide support to you during your radio show, contact you in case of an emergency, and schedule you appropriately with our priority system.
- OneCard information is collected from Record Libe patrons to facilitate the circulation of Record Libe media.
- We collect biographical information to allow you to establish a public "profile" and share some information about yourself with other DJs and listeners. This is completely optional and provided as a convenience to you.

## How long do we retain the information we collect?

As a general rule, information collected automatically is discarded automatically when it is no longer needed, while information that you provide will stay associated with your account for as long as you have it.

Some information has strict deletion schedules:

- Raw logs: Purged once they are 72 hours old.
- Phone numbers: Removed from your account and deleted once your membership has been inactive for one year or longer.
- OneCard information: Removed from your account and deleted one year after last use.

## Automated decisions

Whether you are a resident of the European Union or not, you have a right to know that **we do not make automated decisions about you or your KRLX membership.**

Our priority system, which is used to sort shows into a scheduling queue, converts several known factors such as terms of experience and class year into a shortened form.
This is a two-way process that can be done - and verified - manually at any time.
Experience points are issued manually (by this we mean the process of issuing points is initiated manually, after we manually flag any accounts that need additional review - it's a little impractical to issue nearly 300 experience points, one at a time, to every user account eligible for them in a given term).

While we hope we don't need to issue any sanctions on your account, this is also a manual process that must be approved by the Board of Directors.

## How we use and share your information

- Your name is used to personalize your account, any communications we send you, and attribute your radio shows to you. We publish your name in our catalog (you can choose to use a pseudonym instead) and store it in our permanent operations and staff logs.
- Your email address is used to allow us to communicate with you, and for you to sign in to your account. Your email address may be shared with anyone you co-host a show with, but we do not publish it.
- Your phone number stays private and is only shared with your co-host(s), the host(s) of the show immediately before yours, and members of the Board of Directors who need to know it. Phone numbers are used to ensure that the station is always occupied, and Board members only access phone numbers in case of an emergency.
- Your OneCard information is not shared with anyone. It's used to quickly look up your account while you use the Record Libe.
- Your borrowing history from the Record Libe is not shared with anyone except the Record Libe Manager. Anonymous statistics derived from your borrowing history help us understand which items are being circulated more than others.
- If you are a Carleton student, the last two digits of your class year may be published in our catalog. Faculty and staff do not have their class years published.
- Show titles, descriptions, track, tags, and promotional images are published in our catalogs and other feeds. All other fields within show applications are kept private and only seen by hosts and the scheduling team.
- All other information, including show titles and public profile information, is actively published on the open Internet.

## Your rights

- You can withdraw your consent for us to store your personal information at any time. This is done by deleting your account.
- You can delete your account at any time, at which point all personally identifiable information about you in our databases will be permanently erased.
- Residents of the European Union have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation.
