**Welcome to KRLX, and thanks for applying for a radio show!**
We're excited to review your application(s) and potentially get you a slot on the air.
We need to get your signature of our membership agreement first before we can review your application.
This agreement is good for any number of shows in a single academic term.
You will need to sign the agreement again in future terms, and anyone who does a show with you must also sign the agreement.

**By applying for a radio show on KRLX and accepting a time slot you agree to follow all KRLX and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines, and you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend KRLX if a complaint is received about something you do or broadcast. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CONTENT AIRED DURING YOUR ASSIGNED TIME SLOT - EVEN IF SOMEONE ELSE IS SITTING IN THE STUDIO OR PICKED UP ON A MICROPHONE OR CALL.**

We recognize that this agreement has a lot of serious-sounding stuff in it, and we hope this is the most stern we have to get.
Most shows have no issues and have a great time on air, and we hope this is the case for you too.
If you have any questions, please contact the Compliance Director.

## Prohibited content

Federal broadcasting guidelines, and the structure of the KRLX broadcasting license, restrict some content from the air.
Broadcasting any of the following content on KRLX is **ILLEGAL** and will result in your immediate suspension:

- Obscene content
- Indecent or profane content (outside of safe harbor)
- Indecent or profane content without artistic merit
- Anything you know to be false or misleading
- Anything that could put the public at risk or incite listeners to break the law
- Bootleg or pirated material, including leaked music
- Other radio stations' live streams
- Advertisements or promotions from commercial entities, or anything that could be interpreted as such _(this rule includes ads from YouTube and Spotify!)_
- Any content that you are being paid to broadcast ("payment" includes non-monetary compensation, i.e. merchandise, concert tickets, promotions, etc)
- Calls to action

While not necessarily illegal, it is extremely unethical (and against KRLX policy) to broadcast the following content:

- The full identity of a caller or anyone outside the public domain. You must reference callers, guests, and other third parties by their first name unless you have their permission OR they fall under one of the following categories:
  - Politicians
  - Notable celebrities
  - Music artists (please use the name they record under)
  - Carleton College administrative officials at and above the level of Associate Dean (including all Vice Presidents, Deans, the College President, and members of the Board of Trustees), plus members of the Tuesday Group
- Libel and slander (these are often used interchangeably)
- Complaints about the policy, programming, or management of KRLX or any other station
- Perpetuating stereotypes, making fun of a protected group, or perpetuating content that promotes sexual violence
- Anything that you don't want your extended family or future employer to hear

We also strive to produce professional content, and so the following unprofessional behaviors are also not allowed while broadcasting:

- Reading PSAs, liner notes, approved promotions, or other material in a non-professional manner, or mocking or making other disrespectful comments about them
- Editorializing without a disclaimer
- Playing system and notification sounds from your computer or portable media device
- Playing music or talking over pre-recorded material
- Criticizing or being rude or disrespectful to KRLX personnel, callers, or guests
- Downgrading or talking down to listeners, artists, or other stations
- Having on-air conversations with someone off microphone
- Telling inside jokes
- Explicitly promoting the use of alcohol or drugs
- Begging people to listen or call in to KRLX
- Complaining about broadcasting regulations

Finally, it is illegal to operate radio broadcasting equipment while intoxicated.

## Your duties as a DJ

Your responsibilities while in the studio include, but are not limited to:

- Arriving to your show on time
- Accurately completing operations and song logs, and any additional paperwork assigned to you
- Staying in the studio at all times unless the building is being evacuated by Security
- Giving a call sign as close to 0 and 30 minutes past the hour as possible
- **Never** saying the 7 dirty words _(piss, shit, fuck, cunt, motherfucker, cocksucker, tits)_ or derivatives, even if your show is scheduled during Safe Harbor Hours
- Playing underwriting announcements, PSAs, new music, and other content as assigned by the Board
- Reporting any equipment failures to engineers (calling the emergency line if necessary)
- Minimizing dead air and white noise
- Answering all phone calls (remember to get the caller's consent before putting them on air!)
- Maintaining station security and cleanliness
- Reminding guests and callers of the rules before putting them on air

You are responsible for the actions of your callers and guests, so please remind them of the rules before inviting them into KRLX or putting them on air.
If you observe other DJs violating these rules, inform the Compliance Director right away.

Leaving the studio empty is **illegal** and is grounds for termination.
If no one in the studio is a host of a radio show this term, it's treated the same as if it were completely empty.

Failure to accurately complete operations logs is **illegal** and may result in the show being counted as missed.

## Rescheduling and cancellation policy

Weekly shows will be scheduled after applications close.
You will receive an email when your initial time is assigned.
If your time changes, you will be notified of the change as soon as it is published.

Reschedule requests are only permitted under the following circumstances:

- You are assigned a time that creates a scheduling conflict, as declared on your show application.
- You are assigned a time that creates a scheduling conflict that you were became aware of after applications closed.
- You have found another show that will switch times with you.
- Special circumstances arise and the Programming Director has approved a reschedule request.

Reschedule requests must be submitted via email to the Programming Director at least 24 hours before KRLX goes on the air.
Requests submitted after this time may be processed at the discretion of the Programming Director.

**PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR SCHEDULE AND ENSURE IT IS UP TO DATE. We reserve the right to refuse a reschedule request if you fail to declare a known conflict on your application.**

Show conflicts must be legitimate.
We reserve the right to verify your schedule and assign you to any time outside of your legitimate conflicts.
Be prepared to justify overnight or large numbers of conflicts.

**SHOW TIMES MAY CHANGE AFTER INITIAL ASSIGNMENT TO ACCOMMODATE RESCHEDULES.**
We will make every effort to minimize collateral damage of a reschedule.
Times are not guaranteed until the schedule is locked.

Shows may not be dropped after initial times are assigned, except in extreme circumstances.
If you feel that this applies to you, please email the Programming Director and Station Manager as soon as you determine that you need to drop your show.
You can drop your show online, no questions asked, at any time while applications are open.

## Attendance policy

You are responsible for filling your assigned time slot, even if it occurs during Mid-Term Break or a large campus event.
If you know that you will miss or arrive late to a show, you need to request a cover well in advance.

Only DJs who are hosts on a radio show during the current academic term and who have been trained can cover for you.

You are expected to arrive to your show on time - even a few minutes early if you can.
You will be charged with a missed show if you do not arrive at all, if you are unreasonably late, or if an emergency cover is needed to fill your time slot.
All members of a group show will be charged with a missed show if no one arrives on time.

If the DJ(s) in the show after you have not arrived within 5 minutes of their scheduled start time, you can start calling them.
You will be provided with their phone numbers when the schedule is locked.
If (and _ONLY_ if) you attempt and fail to get in touch with them, you may request an emergency cover by following the instructions posted in the studio.

Missing too many shows (without a cover) in one term will result in your experience points being withheld, and/or additional sanctions as deemed appropriate by the Compliance Director.

## Miscellaneous policies

No food in the studio.
Non-alcoholic beverages are permitted in a closed container only, but please be careful (water and electronics don't mix).
If you see or make a mess in the studio, clean it up.

Sayles-Hill Campus Center is a substance- and smoke-free building.
Controlled substances, including alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs, are not allowed in any portion of KRLX.

We reserve the right to record and archive shows.
We may, at our discretion, make your tapes available to you.

All DJs must be trained by the Compliance Director at the start of their career.
DJs must be re-trained if they have been inactive for one year or longer, or if directed by the Board.

You are required to have an accurate phone number on file with KRLX, and we reserve the right to verify its accuracy.
If your number changes, you need to update your account on the website as soon as possible.
If we find that you have given us an inaccurate phone number, you will be suspended from KRLX until the problem is fixed.

**KRLX has a zero tolerance policy against violence (sexual or otherwise), theft, damage to property, and discrimination. Should we become aware of any such incidents within the station or at our official events, we will report them to the appropriate authorities - without pleasure, but without hesitation. We strive to create an open and inclusive community of content creators, and these types of behaviors hinder our ability to do so.**

Finally, have fun and enjoy creating and sharing content with the world.
KRLX is a unique place because of DJs like you, and we hope your participation will allow us to continue this tradition for decades to come!
