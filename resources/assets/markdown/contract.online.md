### **Please note: all times are to be marked in Central Standard Time!**

This is the application for normal weekly recurring shows. Due to our current extenuating circumstances, we are adding the option of hosting week to week one time shows; if you wish to apply for a weekly show fill out the weekly show form.

This is a strange time and there are still a lot of uncertainties with this term. We hope KRLX shows can give us all a moment to feel a part of our community and breathe.

Welcome to KRLX, and thanks for applying for a radio show! We're excited to review your application(s) and potentially get you a slot on the air.  We need to get your signature of our membership agreement first before we can review your application. This agreement is good for any number of shows in a single academic term. You will need to sign the agreement again in future terms, and anyone who does a show with you must also sign the agreement.

The membership agreement can be revised at any time, so please review it carefully. You can view the membership agreement and its version history at any time on GitHub [here](https://github.com/krlxfm/website/blob/master/resources/assets/markdown/contract.md).

By applying for a radio show on KRLX and accepting a time slot you agree to follow all KRLX guidelines, and you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend KRLX if a complaint is received about something you do or broadcast. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CONTENT AIRED DURING YOUR ASSIGNED TIME SLOT.

We recognize that this agreement has a lot of serious-sounding stuff in it, and we hope this is the most stern we have to get. Most shows have no issues and have a great time on air, and we hope this is the case for you too. If you have any questions, please contact the Compliance Director. 

During this strange and difficult time, we hope to unite together as a community to support and care for each other. If your show ever feels like it is adding stress or any other difficulty comes up, please do not hesitate to reach out to the Compliance Director to cancel your show. 

Sending love!!!

- Perpetuating stereotypes, making fun of a protected group, or perpetuating content that promotes sexual violence

- Anything that you don't want your extended family or future employer to hear

We also strive to produce professional content, and so the following unprofessional behaviors are also not allowed while broadcasting:

- Begging people to listen or call in to KRLX

## Your duties as a DJ

Your responsibilities while on air include, but are not limited to:

- Logging on to your show on time & remaining there for the duration
- Playing underwriting announcements, PSAs, new music, and other content as assigned by the Board
- Minimizing dead air and white noise

If you observe other DJs violating these rules, inform the Compliance Director right away.

## Rescheduling and cancellation policy

Weekly Shows

Weekly shows will be scheduled after applications close. You will receive an email when your initial time is assigned. If your time changes, you will be notified of the change as soon as it is published. Under the current circumstances these rules will be relaxed, but following to them will make scheduling shows much easier.

Reschedule requests are permitted under the following circumstances:

- You are assigned a time that creates a scheduling conflict, as declared on your show application.
- You are assigned a time that creates a scheduling conflict that you were became aware of after applications closed. (You can continue to edit your schedule after you submit your application.)
- You have found another show that will switch times with you.
- Special circumstances arise and the Programming Director has approved a reschedule request.
- A time that may add stress

Please try to send reschedule requests via email to the Programming Director at least 24 hours before KRLX goes on the air. Requests submitted after this time may be processed at the discretion of the Programming Director.

PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR SCHEDULE AND ENSURE IT IS UP TO DATE.

All declarations must be in Central Standard Time.

Show conflicts must be legitimate. We reserve the right to verify your schedule and assign you to any time outside of your legitimate conflicts, though we will make every attempt to assign you to a time you list as a preference.

WEEKLY SHOW TIMES MAY CHANGE AFTER INITIAL ASSIGNMENT TO ACCOMMODATE RESCHEDULES. We will make every effort to minimize collateral damage of a reschedule. Times are not guaranteed until the schedule is locked.

Weekly shows may be dropped after initial times are assigned, If you feel that this applies to you, please email the Programming Director and Station Manager as soon as you determine that you need to drop your show. You can drop your show online, no questions asked, at any time while applications are open.

## Overnight Shows Policy

This is something we are still figuring out for this unprecedented term. For the most part we will look at show preferences and timezones to account for as many convenient hours as possible. We are only streaming online, so the rules of the FCC do not apply. In this pandemic we do not want to exacerbate stress or detract from sleep, so the 24 hour schedule may be altered. 

We will try to be accommodating to the needs of djs; please do not hesitate to reach out.

## Attendance policy

You are responsible for filling your assigned time slot, even if it occurs during Mid-Term Break or a large campus event. If you know that you will miss or start late to a show, you need to report for a cover well in advance. By reporting the show early it can be offered to one time djs. 

You are expected to start your show on time - even a few minutes early if you can. 

Please report your missing show to allow other djs the slot.

## Miscellaneous policies

We reserve the right to record and archive shows. We may, at our discretion, make your tapes available to you.

All DJs must be trained and set up for digital broadcasting. They must follow the online streaming guide and attend a webinar training session.

Every DJ should be familiar with the streaming software before broadcasting. 

You are required to have an accurate phone number on file with KRLX, and we reserve the right to verify its accuracy. If your phone number changes, you need to update your account on the website as soon as possible. If we find that you have given us an inaccurate phone number, you will be suspended from KRLX until the problem is fixed.

KRLX has a zero tolerance policy against violence (sexual or otherwise), theft, damage to property, and discrimination. Should we become aware of any such incidents within the station or at our official events, we will report them to the appropriate authorities - without pleasure, but without hesitation. We strive to create an open and inclusive community of content creators, and these types of behaviors hinder our ability to do so.

Finally, have fun and enjoy creating and sharing content with the world. KRLX is a unique place because of DJs like you, and we hope your participation will allow us to continue this tradition for decades to come! We hope KRLX can be a source of comfort and support throughout this pandemic.
